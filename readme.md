### Tileset and sprite animations

Following HeartBeast's tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQGXtlmE7k), except with a different tileset (https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-deluxe).

Challenges: The tileset I'm using is 70x70 tiles with a 2 pixel gutter between, so the grid snapping didn't really work. I compensated with grid offset, but it was pretty awkward making the tilemap. There's an XML file for the tilemap, so there's probably a way to just import that, but I wanted to try it manually.
